## Unsupervised Learning
This Unsupervised Learning will contain variety of mini projects with the aim to understand different USL techniques and details.

**Project#1:** AIML module project part I consists of industry based problems statement which can be solved using clustering techniques.

**DOMAIN:** Automobile

**CONTEXT:** The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5
continuous attributes

**DATA DESCRIPTION:** The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon

**Attribute Information:**
1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)
**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** Goal is to cluster the data and treat them as individual datasets to train Regression models to predict ‘mpg’


**Project#2** AIML module project part II consists of designing a synthetic data generation model for a company which has a predesigned dataset.

**DOMAIN:** Manufacturing

**DATA DESCRIPTION:** The data concerns the chemical composition of the wine and its respective quality.

**Attribute Information:**
1. A, B, C, D: specific chemical composition measure of the wine
2. Quality: quality of wine [ Low and High ]

**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** Goal is to build a synthetic data generation model using the existing data provided by the company.


**Project#3** AIML module project part III consists of industry based problems statement which can be solved using dimensional reduction techniques

**DOMAIN:** Automobile

**DATA DESCRIPTION:** The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles
were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of
vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more
difficult to distinguish between the cars. All the features are numeric i.e. geometric features extracted from the silhouette.

**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** Apply dimensionality reduction technique – PCA and train a model using principal components instead of training the
model using just the raw data.


**Project#4** AIML module project part IV consists of designing a data driven ranking model for a sports management company.

**DOMAIN:** Sports management

**DATA DESCRIPTION:** The data is collected belongs to batsman from IPL series conducted so far. 

**Attribute Information:**
1. Runs: Runs score by the batsman
2. Ave: Average runs scored by the batsman per match
3. SR: strike rate of the batsman
4. Fours: number of boundary/four scored
5. Six: number of boundary/six scored
6. HF: number of half centuries scored so far

**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** Goal is to build a data driven batsman ranking model for the sports management company to make business decisions.
