## Unsupervised Learning
This Unsupervised Learning will contains variaety of projects with different goals and techniques.

**Project#1:** AIML module project part I consists of industry based problems statement which can be solved using clustering techniques.
**DOMAIN:** Automobile
**CONTEXT:** The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5
continuous attributes
**DATA DESCRIPTION:** The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon
**Attribute Information:**
1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)
**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** Goal is to cluster the data and treat them as individual datasets to train Regression models to predict ‘mpg’
